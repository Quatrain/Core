-  Explain why the enhancement would be useful to the broader Quatrain ecosystem.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** on [git.qtrn.io](https://git.qtrn.io/Quatrain/Core) and create your branch from `develop` (`feat/<issue>-<description>` or `fix/<issue>-<description>`).
2. **Install dependencies** using `yarn install`.
3. **Write your code**. Ensure you follow the existing TypeScript patterns and modular structure.
4. **Add tests**. We use Jest for testing. Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality by running `yarn test` in the relevant package.
5. **Update documentation**. If you change an API or add a feature, update the relevant `README.md` within the package.
6. **Submit the PR** on git.qtrn.io, targeting `develop`, with a clear description and `Closes #<issue>`.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

Quatrain Core is a monorepo managed with Yarn workspaces.

-  **Building**: Run `yarn build` from the root or within a specific package.
-  **Testing**: Run `yarn test-ci` to run tests across all packages.
-  **Linting**: Ensure your code follows the project's TypeScript configuration.

## 📝 Coding Standards

-  **TypeScript**: All code must be written in TypeScript.
-  **Modular Design**: Keep adapters decoupled from the core logic.
-  **Clean Code**: Use descriptive variable names and keep functions focused.
